Overflow Detector & Preventer (Core Tool)

Overview
- `css/overflow-preventer.css` and `js/overflow-preventer.js` live in the core and can be included by any presentation when debugging overflow.
- Additional scripts in this folder are development helpers and examples (not required at runtime).

Usage (optional during authoring)
- Include the CSS/JS in your HTML when you want to highlight overflows in authoring mode:

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../css/overflow-preventer.css">
  <script src="../../js/overflow-preventer.js"></script>

- Remove these two lines for final export to keep output clean.

Moved From
- Previously under `WebLeaper_Presentation/overflow-detector/` in the project folder; consolidated here to keep project folders clean.
