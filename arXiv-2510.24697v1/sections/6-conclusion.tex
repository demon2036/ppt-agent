\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we addressed the critical challenge of low search efficiency in LLM-based information-seeking agents, a bottleneck that constrains their overall performance. We argued that the sparsity of target entities in conventional training tasks is a primary contributor to this inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduced \w, a novel framework for constructing entity-intensive IS tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. By formulating IS as a tree-structured reasoning problem and systematically increasing task complexity through our \texttt{Basic}, \texttt{Union}, and \texttt{Reverse-Union} task synthesis variants, we created a rich training environment. Furthermore, our information-guided trajectory curation, using ISR and ISE metrics, ensures that the agent learns from solutions that are both accurate and efficient. Our extensive experiments demonstrated that \w consistently improves performance across five challenging benchmarks, validating that enhancing search efficiency is a powerful lever for boosting the overall capabilities of IS agents.
